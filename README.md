# THE 2020 PERSONALIZED VOICE TRIGGER CHALLENGE BASELINE SYSTEM

Our baseline system consists of a wake-up system and a speaker verification system. As shown in figure below, we designed a two-pass system to respond whenever anyone in the vicinity says the trigger phrase. When the KWS system triggers, the speaker verification system starts to decide whether the sound that trig-gered the  detector is likely to be keywords spoken by theenrolled user.
